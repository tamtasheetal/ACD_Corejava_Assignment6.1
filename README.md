# ACD_Corejava_Assignment6.1
This assignment tested my skills using Arrays in Java.

Objective : This assignment will help you to master the following concepts  ->   Arrays

Problem Statement : Declare an integer array of size 10. Initialize using for loop with 1 to 10, and print all even numbers from an array.

I have initialized the elements of the array. One extra special thing in this program is I have only used one for loop in order to reduce time and space complexity of program.

I have uploaded the screenshot of console output which is exactly same as asked one. I have taken care of proper commenting and camelCase declaration style.
